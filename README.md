1. Quick dive into titanic dataset
  
        The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

        On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
        Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

         i)   Analyzing each feature and check whether it is important in our analysis?

         ii)  What are the most important features to estimate the death?

         iii) What are the top amenities people needs most?


        Results of the analysis

        Results and discussion were published on my blog: Dive Into Titanic dataset
        https://deeplearning.art.blog/2020/05/08/quick-dive-into-titanic-dataset/

        In this project, I dived into the interesting dataset and found many interesting results:

        i)   People travelling with low fare tickets died.
        
        ii)  Majority of deaths comprised of males between 20-40 years.
        
        iii) There is a notable outcomings which showed bias towards people who died i.e factors like in which class they were travelling 
             also came out to be important.
